# Requirement Walker

A simple python package which makes it easy to crawl/parse/walk over the requirements within a `requirements.txt` file. It can handle nested requirement files, i.e. `-r ./nested_path/other_reqs.txt` and handle paths to local pip packages (but cannot currently parse their requirements): `./pip_package/my_pip_package # requirement-walk: local-package-name=my-package`. Comments within the requirement files can also be preserved.

## Installation

```bash
pip install requirement-walker
```

## Arguments

Arguments for `requirement-walker` are parsed from the comments within the `requirements.txt` files.

Arguments should follow the pattern of:

```python
flat-earth==1.1.1 # requirement-walker: {arg1_name}={arg1_val}
bigfoot==0.0.1 # He is real requirement-walker: {arg1_name}={arg1_val}|{arg2_name}={arg2_val1},{arg2_val2}
```

Available arguments:
| Name | Expect # of Values | Discription |
| - | -| -|
| local-package-name | 0 or 1 | If a requirement is a path to a local pip package, then provide this argument to tell the walker that its local. You can optionally tell provide the name of the pip package which can be used when filtering requirements. (See [Example Workflow](#example-workflow)) |
| root-relative | 1 | Can be provided along with `local-package-name` or can be stand alone with any `-r` requirements. When the walker sees a relative path for a requirement, it will use this provided value instead of the value actually in that line of the `requirements.txt` file. |

## Example Workflow

Lets walk through a complex example. Note, I am only doing the `requirement.txt` files like this to give a detailed example. I do NOT recommend you do requirements like this.

### Folder Structure

        └───tests
            |   ...
```

**NOTE:** This package CANNOT currently parse a setup.py file to walk its requirements but we can keep track of the path to the local requirement.

### walk_requirements.py

Assuming `requirement-walker` is already installed in a virtual environment or locally such that it can be imported.

```python
""" Example Script """
# Assuming I am running this script in the directory it is within above.

# Built In
import logging

# 3rd Party
from requirement_walker import walk

# Owned


if __name__ == '__main__':
    FORMAT = '[%(asctime)s] {%(pathname)s:%(lineno)d} %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT, level=logging.DEBUG)
    entries = list(walk('./example_application/project_requirements.txt'))
    print(*entries, sep='\n') # Output found down below
```

### project_requirements.txt

```python
# One-lining just to show multiple -r works on one line, -r is the only thing that works on one line.
-r ./lambdas/s3_event_lambda/s3_lambda_reqs.txt --requirement=./lambdas/api_lambda/api_lambda_reqs.txt

./pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name=orm-models
```

### generic_reqs.txt

```python

pytest==6.1.2
pytest-cov==2.10.1
pylint==2.6.0

```

### s3_lambda_reqs.txt

```python
-r ./../generic_reqs.txt
./../../pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name|root-relative=./pip_packages/orm_models
```

### api_lambda_reqs.txt

```python
-r ./../generic_reqs.txt
./../../pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name|root-relative=./pip_packages/orm_models
```

### Output

```text
... Logs omitted ...
# One-lining just to show multiple -r works on one line, -r is the only thing that works on one line.
moto==1.3.16.dev67
pytest==6.1.2

./pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name=orm-models
```

**NOTE**: Duplicates are NOT filtered out. You can do this on your own if you want using `entry.requirement.name` to filter them out as you iterate.

## Failed Parsing

Sometimes the requirement parser fails. For example, maybe it tries parsing a `-e` or maybe you do a local pip package but don't provide `local-package-name`. If this happens, please open an issue; however, you should still be able to code yourself around the issue or use the walker till a fix is implemented. The walker aims to store as much information as it can, even in cases of failure. See the following example.

### requirements.txt

```python
astroid==2.4.2
attrs==20.3.0
aws-xray-sdk==2.6.0
boto==2.49.0
./local_pips/my_package # This will cause a failed requirement step
boto3==1.16.2
botocore==1.19.28
certifi==2020.11.8
cffi==1.14.4
./pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name
```

### Code

```python
""" Example Script """

# Built In
import logging

# 3rd Party
from requirement_walker import walk

# Owned

if __name__ == '__main__':
    FORMAT = '[%(asctime)s] {%(pathname)s:%(lineno)d} %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT, level=logging.DEBUG)
    entries = list(walk('./requirements.txt'))
    print(*entries, sep='\n')
```

### Code Output

```text
... logs omitted ...
astroid==2.4.2
attrs==20.3.0
aws-xray-sdk==2.6.0
boto==2.49.0
./local_pips/my_package # This will cause a failed requirement step
boto3==1.16.2
botocore==1.19.28
certifi==2020.11.8
cffi==1.14.4
./pip_packages/orm_models # requirement-walker: local-package-name
```

Note that it still printed correctly, but if you look at the logs you will see what happened:

```text
[2020-12-14 11:35:33,277] {...} WARNING - Unable to parse requirement. Doing simple FailedRequirement where name=failed_req and url=./local_pips/my_package. Open Issue in GitHub to have this fixed.
```

If you want, you can refine requirements by looking at class instances:

```python
""" Example Script """

# Built In
import logging

# 3rd Party
from requirement_walker import walk, LocalRequirement, FailedRequirement

# Owned

if __name__ == '__main__':
    FORMAT = '[%(asctime)s] {%(pathname)s:%(lineno)d} %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
    logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT, level=logging.ERROR)
    for entry in walk('./requirements.txt'):
        if isinstance(entry.requirement, FailedRequirement):
            print("This requirement was a failed req.", entry.requirement)
        elif isinstance(entry.requirement, LocalRequirement):
            print("This requirement was a local req.", entry.requirement)
# Ouput:
# This requirement was a failed req. failed_req@ ./local_pips/my_package
# This requirement was a local req. local_req@ ./pip_packages/orm_models
```

## What is an Entry?

We define an entry as a single line within a requirements.txt file which consists of a requirement (except `-r & --requirement`), a comment, or both.

An Entry object has three main attributes: `comment: Comment`, `requirement: Union[pkg_resources.Requirement, FailedRequirement, LocalRequirement]`, and `proxy_requirement: _ProxyRequirement`. Note, you will mainly work with `comment` and `requirement` but there may be cases where the package does not behave properly, in which cases it `proxy_requirement` will hold all the other information pulled by the walker.
